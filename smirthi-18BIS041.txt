Task details: Build an Employee-Department management system, where we should be able to
do the following things:

1) Create new employees and departments ( basic fields of Employee as 'Id'[DB generated],
'EmpName', ‘Age' and for Department as 'Id'[DB Generated], ‘DepName' )

Solution :
CREATE TABLE department( DeptID varchar(10),DepName varchar(40) PRIMARY KEY(DeptID);

CREATE TABLE employees( ID varchar(10),EmpName varchar(40),Age int(3));


INSERT INTO employees VALUES('100','ram',30); 
INSERT INTO employees VALUES('101','sam',33);
INSERT INTO employees VALUES('102','seeta',38);
INSERT INTO employees VALUES('102','seeta',38);


INSERT INTO department VALUES('300','sales');
INSERT INTO department VALUES('301','sales_check');
INSERT INTO department VALUES('302','deploy');

2) Link employees to a particular department
 

ALTER TABLE employees ADD DeptID varchar(20),FOREIGN KEY(DeptId) REFERENCES department(DeptID);

UPDATE employees SET DeptID = 300 where ID=100;
UPDATE employees SET DeptID = 301 where ID=101;
UPDATE employees SET DeptID = 301 where ID=102;
UPDATE employees SET DeptID = 302 where ID=103;

3) Change the department of any employee

UPDATE employees SET DeptID = 303 where ID=103;

4)Delete an employee and/or department

DELETE From employees WHERE EmpName='ram';

7) Implement searching of data based on any field search

SELECT empName from employees where ID="101";
